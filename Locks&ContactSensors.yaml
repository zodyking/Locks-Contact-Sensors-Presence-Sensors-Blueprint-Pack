    ![Aqara](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zodyking/Aqara-Lock---Sensor-Blueprint/refs/heads/main/image1.png)

    Automates a smart lock using a door contact sensor with optional spoken announcements.
    Built for reliability and clear speech.

    What it does
    • Auto-locks the door X seconds after the sensor reports CLOSED (single, reliable guard).
    • Cancels the lock if the sensor re-opens during the delay window.
    • Speaks OPENED/CLOSED and LOCKED/UNLOCKED (only after real, confirmed state changes).
    • Optional reminders: repeats a message every X seconds while the door is OPEN
      and/or the lock is UNLOCKED, until it’s resolved (stops immediately when fixed).
    • Optional action: turn on selected lights/switches when the door opens.
    • All speech is queued (mode: queued, max: 2) and a small TTS pre-roll prevents clipped words.

    Setup
    1) Select the contact sensor and the lock.
    2) (Optional) Choose a TTS engine (e.g., tts.piper) and select one or more media_player targets.
    3) Set Auto-lock delay to your preference.
    4) (Optional) Enable reminders and set the interval, and/or select entities to turn on when the door opens.

    Notes
    • The spoken “room” name comes from the entity’s Area (Settings → Areas). Assign your devices to Areas for natural phrases.
    • Lock announcements trigger only when the lock actually reports locked/unlocked (with a brief confirmation).
    • Works with Aqara and other standard Home Assistant binary_sensor/lock entities.

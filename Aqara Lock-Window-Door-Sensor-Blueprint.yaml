  name: Aqara Door/Window Auto-Lock + Announce (Queued)
  description: |-
  ![Aqara](https://www.allthethings.best/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Aqara-logo-scaled.jpg)

  Automates an Aqara (or any) smart lock using a door/window contact sensor, with optional
  spoken announcements. Designed for reliability and clear speech.

  What it does
  • Auto-locks the door X seconds after the sensor reports CLOSED.
  • Cancels auto-lock if the sensor re-opens at any point before the lock command.
  • Optional “closed stability” window filters sensor bounce before locking.
  • Announces sensor OPENED/CLOSED and lock LOCKED/UNLOCKED (only after real state changes).
  • All announcements queue (mode: queued, max: 8) to avoid overlapping audio.
  • Built-in TTS pre-roll prevents clipped first words.

  Setup
  1) Select the contact sensor and the lock.
  2) (Optional) Enable announcements, choose a TTS engine (e.g., tts.piper), and select one
     or more media_player targets.
  3) Tune Auto-lock delay and Closed stability to match your door behavior.
  4) (Optional) Provide custom messages; you can use {room} to insert the device’s Area name.

  Notes
  • The spoken “room” name comes from the entity’s Area (Settings → Areas). Assign your devices
    to Areas for natural phrases.
  • Lock announcements trigger only when the lock actually reports locked/unlocked (no guesses).
  • Works with Aqara and other standard Home Assistant binary_sensor/lock entities.
